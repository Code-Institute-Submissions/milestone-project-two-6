Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

Blockworm Adventure is based on our beloved Nokia's Snake game with some more twists and turns
but most of all, upgraded graphics.

## UX
The website/game is designed in a simplistic manager so the visitors can easily try out the game
but also assist with further development with a built in feedback form API.

I also encourage the visitors to visit the code itself to make their feedback even more relevant.

Strong but not overwhelming colors have been chosen to emphasis on the features.

## Technologies
