Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

Blockworm Adventure is based on our beloved Nokia's Snake game with some more twists and turns
but most of all, upgraded graphics.

## UX
The website/game is designed in a simplistic manager so the visitors can easily try out the game
but also assist with further development with a built in feedback form API.

I also encourage the visitors to visit the code itself to make their feedback even more relevant.

Strong but not overwhelming colors have been chosen to emphasis on the features.

## Features
Blockworm Adventure is a game designed to provide the visitor with 
a updated version of the old snake game, and add some new unexpected
twists to introduce a fresh experience.

- Feature 1: allows users to try them self at a new type of snake game by controlling the snake to capture as much food as possible.

- Feature 2: The games comes with multiple "food types", providing different twists and points each type.

- Feature 3: Once the player have finished the game by accidentally hitting the wall or the body of the snake, 
they get to see their highscore on a separate window.

- Feature 4: We welcome our players to provide feedback by visiting our feedback
section of the website, writing their thoughts on the game.   

####Features Left to Implement

- Adding multiple maps.
- Including randomized fruit types and events.
